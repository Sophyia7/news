**Cincinnati, OH - Pieces for Developers, a deep tech startup, announced today that it has raised $8 million in a series seed funding round led by Drive Capital, a Columbus-based venture capital firm. Additionally, the company secured $3 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. The funding was raised in June 2021, and the company plans to use the capital to accelerate the product development of its first-in-kind productivity suite for developers.**

Pieces for Developers is rethinking the modern developer workflow to eliminate the chaos of context switching and be more efficient in their research and collaboration. The suite plugs into and streamlines existing developer tools to provide a unified, customizable environment, save time and improve productivity.

> We are thrilled to partner with Drive Capital and Silicon Valley Bank to take Pieces to the next level," said Tsavo Knott, Co-founder and CEO of Pieces for Developers. "Our vision is to become the go-to productivity suite for developers, and this funding will enable us to bring our platform to even more developers worldwide.

The investment round was led by Chris Olsen of Drive Capital. Olsen later joined the Pieces team as its newest board member.

The funding round will enable Pieces for Developers to expand its team, invest in product development, and scale its platform to meet the growing demand from developers worldwide.
