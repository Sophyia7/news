We’re extremely excited to be in Austin this week for Civo Navigate North America! Coming all the way from Cincinnati, San Francisco, and Spain, we're thrilled to join the conference as Diamond sponsors. Dive into discussions on how the cutting-edge realms of generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping the landscape of developer workflows. It's an opportunity you won't want to miss as we explore the future of AI together.

## Pieces Sponsor Booth

Make sure to swing by our booth in the sponsor hall during the event! Our team is eager to engage in insightful conversations about the transformative power of AI/ML, the intricacies of productionizing and fine-tuning LLMs, and the significant impact these technologies have on enhancing developer productivity.

## Talks/Sessions

### Managing the Chaos of Developer Workflows with Pieces through AI

* Who: Tsavo Knott
* When: 10:30 - 10:40 AM
* Where: CONNALLY BALLROOM (MAIN STAGE)

In a short 10-minute section of the keynote, Tsavo Knott, Technical Co-Founder and CEO of Pieces for Developers, will describe the critical challenges that today's developers face, the enterprise struggles to keep up, and some solutions for how to move forward in this new era.

The presentation will focus on how the rapid advancement of technology, exponential increases in documentation, and challenges of dispersed teams demand adaptive strategies for development teams to stay ahead.

Tsavo will shed light on the current landscape of software development, emphasizing the necessity of innovative approaches, including AI tools like Pieces, to navigate the chaos effectively. Tsavo will offer a fresh perspective on leveraging AI to streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and foster better team collaboration in the face of growing development complexities.

### A Practical Discussion on Implementing AI Technologies into Developer Tools

* Who: Tsavo Knott
* When: 11:15 - 11:55 AM
* Where: COWBOY PAVILLION

Understand the complexities behind creating and bringing to market AI-enabled tools for developers, without resorting to the simple GPT-wrapper strategy. Here we will focus on the underlying technologies behind innovative startups that are reshaping the development landscape.

Discover the intricate workings of LoRA models, their critical role in AI-driven auto-enrichment, and the challenges in fine-tuning these models for practical applications. Learn about the groundbreaking integration of isomorphic LLMs, operational both in cloud and local environments, and the hurdles in optimizing these models for efficiency and effectiveness across different devices.

We'll also discuss the implementation of advanced OCR within developer tools by examining the balance between power and usability. The session will cover the extension of LLMs to broaden context windows, an important aspect in enhancing AI assistance for coding.

This talk goes beyond theoretical exploration and addresses the real-world challenges of productionizing these sophisticated technologies on a budget. From ensuring seamless integration into developers' workflows to maintaining performance and reliability, we'll cover the journey of transforming these AI concepts into tangible tools.
