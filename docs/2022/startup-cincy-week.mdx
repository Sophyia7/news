From October 10-14 2022, Pieces was proud to sponsor Startup Cincy week. Hosted by Cintrifuse and Union Hall, [Startup Cincy week](https://startupcincy.com/startupcincyweek/) was a showcase and celebration of all of the startups that Cincinnati has to offer, including Pieces for Developers. The Pieces Team participated in job fairs, pitch competitions, and community-building events all week long, and are immensely proud to be a pillar of the Cincinnati Startup community.
