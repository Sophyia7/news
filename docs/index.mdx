Pieces was showcased on GitHub's YouTube channel and across their social media to hundreds of thousands of subscribers. This was the inaugural episode of GitHub's "Start it up Wednesday," a new show hosted by GitHub's Rizel Scarlett. Tsavo Knott demonstrated how Pieces for Developers integrates with a modern developer's workflow on the episode titled, “Optimizing your Development Workflow with AI.”

The livestream was over an hour long and showcased cutting-edge machine learning that left the audience awestruck. Knott demoed the latest features of the Pieces Desktop app, including the ability to generate new code from a short, plain English description, provide relevant descriptions and links to external resources, and share with teammates (soon via Microsoft Teams). He also demonstrated offline capabilities, proving that the age of on-device ML is here.

> Pieces for Developers Welcomed into Microsoft 365 Ecosystem as Startup Partner

As we broaden our range of integrations and plugins to cover the entire developer workflow, we have joined forces with Microsoft as a partner startup.

> Our collaboration with Microsoft will include developing a Pieces product for Microsoft Teams to help expand the Teams value proposition for developers.

We plan to nurture this relationship as we share customers among the vast number of developers using GitHub, Visual Studio Code and Teams. We are excited to work with Microsoft to bring innovative solutions to these customers and appreciate their support.

<EventHeader p="February 8, 2023" h1="ONNX Runtime Microsoft Blog"></EventHeader>

Pieces for Developers featured on the Microsoft Open Source Blog, highlighting the partnership between ONNX Runtime (Microsoft) and Pieces.

We embed ML into all of our products to ensure full coverage of the developer workflow. Pieces needs to run these models from the desktop, terminal, integrated development environment, browser, and team communication channels.

<a href="https://onnxruntime.ai">ONNX Runtime</a> emerged as the clear winner for an on-device model serving platform that would provide Pieces with low latency, privacy, and performance, while still giving machine learning engineers the flexibility that cloud serving offers. ONNX Runtime offers a standardized model optimization pipeline, and Pieces has used ONNX Runtime's convert generation.py tool to implement a T5 transformer model for code description generation. ONNX Runtime gracefully meets both performance and state-of-the-art machine learning model needs.

<EventHeader p="February 1, 2023" h1="In-House ML + OpenAI’s GPT-4 Power AI in Pieces"></EventHeader>

When you save a code snippet to Pieces, our offline and on-device AI auto-enriches those developer materials. This makes it easier for our users to save, search, share, reference, and reuse their code snippets throughout their work-in-progress journey.

In an effort to continuously improve our in-product experiences, we quickly integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and now GPT-4 APIs. This will give users who take advantage of our Blended ML Model option advanced AI capabilities that merge the best of our in-house ML with OpenAI’s. Language classifications, tags, descriptions, and related links will all receive a boost.

> <a target="_blank" href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/pieces-developers-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> dramatically increases the volume of code written every day. With that, we are seeing a role-change in developer workflows, where there is not only an increased need to curate from these generated materials; but further, developers are needing to save, search, share, reference, and reuse the outputs of Generative AI like we've never seen before.
