Pieces was showcased on GitHub's YouTube channel and across their social media to hundreds of thousands of subscribers. This was the inaugural episode of GitHub's "Start it up Wednesday," a new show hosted by GitHub's Rizel Scarlett. Tsavo Knott demonstrated how Pieces for Developers integrates with a modern developer's workflow on the episode titled, “Optimizing your Development Workflow with AI.”

The livestream was over an hour long and showcased cutting-edge machine learning that left the audience awestruck. Knott demoed the latest features of the Pieces Desktop app, including the ability to generate new code from a short, plain English description, provide relevant descriptions and links to external resources, and share with teammates (soon via Microsoft Teams). He also demonstrated offline capabilities, proving that the age of on-device ML is here.<ReadMore hreflang="/2023/github-showcase-on-youtube"></ReadMore>

> Pieces for Developers Welcomed into Microsoft 365 Ecosystem as Startup Partner


As we broaden our range of integrations and plugins to cover the entire developer workflow, we have joined forces with Microsoft as a partner startup. Our collaboration with Microsoft will include developing a Pieces product for Microsoft Teams to help expand the Teams value proposition for developers. We plan to nurture this relationship as we share customers among the vast number of developers using GitHub, Visual Studio Code and Teams. We are excited to work with Microsoft to bring innovative solutions to these customers and appreciate their support.

<EventHeader p="February 8, 2023" h1="ONYX Runtime Microsoft Blog"></EventHeader>

Pieces for Developers featured on the Microsoft Open Source Blog, highlighting the partnership between ONNX Runtime (Microsoft) and Pieces.

We embed ML into all of our products to ensure full coverage of the developer workflow. Pieces needs to run these models from the desktop, terminal, integrated development environment, browser, and team communication channels. ONNX Runtime emerged as the clear winner for an on-device model serving platform that would provide Pieces with low latency, privacy, and performance, while still giving machine learning engineers the flexibility that cloud serving offers. ONNX Runtime offers a standardized model optimization pipeline, and Pieces has used ONNX Runtime's convert generation.py tool to implement a T5 transformer model for code description generation. ONNX Runtime gracefully meets both performance and state-of-the-art machine learning model needs.

**Cincinnati, OH - Pieces for Developers, a deep tech startup, announced today that it has raised $8 million in a series seed funding round led by Drive Capital, a Columbus-based venture capital firm. Additionally, the company secured $3 million in venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. The funding was raised in June 2021, and the company plans to use the capital to accelerate the product development of its first-in-kind productivity suite for developers.**

Pieces for Developers is rethinking the modern developer workflow to eliminate the chaos of context switching and allow developers to be more efficient in their research and collaboration. The suite plugs into and streamlines existing developer tools to provide a unified, customizable environment, saving time and improving productivity.

> We are thrilled to partner with Drive Capital and Silicon Valley Bank to take Pieces to the next level," said Tsavo Knott, Co-founder and CEO of Pieces for Developers. "Our vision is to become the go-to productivity suite for developers, and this funding will enable us to bring our platform to even more developers worldwide.

The investment round was led by Chris Olsen of Drive Capital. Olsen later joined the Pieces team as its newest board member.
