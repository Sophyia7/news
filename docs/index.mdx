##### Pieces was showcased on GitHub’s YouTube channel and across their social media to hundreds of thousands of subscribers. This was the inaugural episode of GitHub’s ‘Start it up Wednesday,’ a new show hosted by GitHub’s Rizel Scarlett. Tsavo showcased a modern developer’s workflow on the episode titled, “Optimizing your Development Workflow with AI.”

##### The Live Stream was over an hour long and showcased cutting edge machine learning that left the audience awestruck. Tsavo demoed the latest features of the Pieces Desktop app, including the ability to generate new code from a short plain English description, provide relevant descriptions and links to external resources, and share with teammates (soon via Microsoft Teams). He also demonstrated offline capabilities, proving that the age of on-device ML is here.

# ONNX Runtime Microsoft Blog
#### ```February 8, 2023```

Pieces for Developers featured on the Microsoft Open Source Blog, highlighting the partnership between ONNX Runtime (Microsoft) and Pieces.

We embed ML into all of our products to ensure full coverage of the developer workflow. Pieces needs to run these models from the desktop, terminal, integrated development environment, browser, and team communication channels. ONNX Runtime emerged as the clear winner for an on-device model serving platform that would provide Pieces with low latency, privacy, and performance, while still giving machine learning engineers the flexibility that cloud serving offers. ONNX Runtime offers a standardized model optimization pipeline, and Pieces has used ONNX Runtime’s convert generation.py tool to implement a T5 transformer model for code description generation. ONNX Runtime gracefully meets both performance and state-of-the-art machine learning model needs.
