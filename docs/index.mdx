##### Pieces was showcased on GitHub’s YouTube channel and across their social media to hundreds of thousands of subscribers. This was the inaugural episode of GitHub’s ‘Start it up Wednesday,’ a new show hosted by GitHub’s Rizel Scarlett. Tsavo showcased a modern developer’s workflow on the episode titled, “Optimizing your Development Workflow with AI.”

##### The Live Stream was over an hour long and showcased cutting edge machine learning that left the audience awestruck. Tsavo demoed the latest features of the Pieces Desktop app, including the ability to generate new code from a short plain English description, provide relevant descriptions and links to external resources, and share with teammates (soon via Microsoft Teams). He also demonstrated offline capabilities, proving that the age of on-device ML is here.

<EventHeader p="February 8, 2023" h1="ONNX Runtime Microsoft Blog"></EventHeader>

Pieces for Developers featured on the Microsoft Open Source Blog, highlighting the partnership between ONNX Runtime (Microsoft) and Pieces.

We embed ML into all of our products to ensure full coverage of the developer workflow. Pieces needs to run these models from the desktop, terminal, integrated development environment, browser, and team communication channels. ONNX Runtime emerged as the clear winner for an on-device model serving platform that would provide Pieces with low latency, privacy, and performance, while still giving machine learning engineers the flexibility that cloud serving offers. ONNX Runtime offers a standardized model optimization pipeline, and Pieces has used ONNX Runtime’s convert generation.py tool to implement a T5 transformer model for code description generation. ONNX Runtime gracefully meets both performance and state-of-the-art machine learning model needs.

**Cincinnati, OH - Pieces for Developers, a deep tech startup, announced today that it has raised $8 million in a series seed funding round led by Drive Capital, a Columbus-based venture capital firm.

The suite plugs into and streamlines existing developer tools to provide a unified, customizable environment, saving time and improving productivity.

> We are thrilled to partner with Drive Capital and Silicon Valley Bank to take Pieces to the next level," said Tsavo Knott, co-founder, and CEO of Pieces for Developers. "Our vision is to become the go-to productivity suite for developers, and this funding will enable us to bring our platform to even more developers worldwide.

The investment round was led by Chris Olsen of Drive Capital, where he later  joined the team as its newest board member.

The funding round will enable Pieces for Developers to expand its team, invest in product development, and scale its platform to meet the growing demand from developers worldwide.
