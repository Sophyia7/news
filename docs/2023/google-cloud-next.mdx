We're excited to share our enriching experiences from [Google Cloud Next](https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/cloud-next-2023-sundar-pichai-keynote/). This event was a testament to the power of networking and collaboration, as we engaged in meaningful discussions with industry leaders like the JetBrains and Google Workspace teams.

Our interactions have paved the way for enhanced product integration and potential GChat developments. Our conversations with SaaS founders shed light on the intricacies of developing for a niche audience.

The insights from the Startup Lounge and various workshops highlighted the transformative potential of generative AI in software development. As we move forward, we're eager to harness these learnings and connections to drive innovation for our community.
