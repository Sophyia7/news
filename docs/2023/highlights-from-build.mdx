Pieces for Developers made a strong showing at Microsoft Build 2023. As a Microsoft Copilot Partner, we are currently building and shipping new experiences to the 300 million monthly active users on Microsoft Teams. Pieces was mentioned multiple times in sessions at Microsoft Build, including in all three keynote addresses.

Here are some of the highlights of Pieces for Developers at Microsoft Build:

- Pieces for Developers was mentioned in all three keynote addresses. Itâ€™s a big milestone for a startup like ours to share the stage with much larger companies. It was great to see our logo up on the screen with businesses that we would love to work with!

- Pieces for Developers had a live demo at Build! The session was about how developers could better use Microsoft Teams. It was well-attended, and many attendees were interested in learning more about Pieces. [Check out what the app enables developers to do in Teams.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoFYQ1PL4lc)

- Pieces for Developers also received a shoutout from our friend Sebastian Holst. He hosted a pre-recorded a session on [Collaboration by design in the age of AI and the modern workplace](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/ec5702f8-1ccb-48ca-8881-87af4a79feef?source=sessions).

Microsoft Build was a great experience for the Pieces for Developers team. We were excited that our focus on building AI-powered experiences for developers directly in the tools that they love is consistent with the messaging and demos that were showcased throughout Build. We look forward to continuing to connect and collaborate with our Microsoft Partner peers by bringing their developers solutions that will help everyone to build better software.
