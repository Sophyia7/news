# Microsoft Partner Startup - February 27, 2023

> Pieces for Developers Welcomed into Microsoft 365 Ecosystem as Startup Partner

As we broaden our range of integrations and plugins to cover the entire developer workflow, we have joined forces with Microsoft as a partner startup. Our collaboration with Microsoft will include developing a Pieces product for Microsoft Teams to help expand the Teams value proposition for Developers. We plan to nurture this relationship as we share customers among the vast number of developers using GitHub, Visual Studio Code and Teams. We are excited to work with Microsoft to bring innovative solutions to these customers and appreciate their support.
