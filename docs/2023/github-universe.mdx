The Pieces team attended GitHub Universe 2023, GitHubâ€™s annual developer conference. The event, held in San Francisco, provided an unparalleled platform for us to delve into the latest advancements in AI and explore how they are shaping the future of software development.

Our team had the opportunity to attend various sessions & events, gaining valuable insights into how GitHub Partners and customers are leveraging AI. The conference was not just about learning; it was also about engaging. We had the privilege of building relationships with leadership from GitHub, Microsoft, and a host of other influential companies present at the event.

Another highlight of our trip was the chance to operate from our satellite office in San Francisco. This gave us a unique opportunity to work closely with our Chief Marketing Officer and strengthen our internal collaboration, mirroring the collaborative spirit of GitHub Universe.

Our experience at GitHub Universe was not just an occasion to witness AI's growing influence in the tech world, but also a chance to connect, collaborate, and envision the future alongside industry giants. We returned inspired, energized, and more committed than ever to fostering innovation within our ranks and across the wider tech community.
