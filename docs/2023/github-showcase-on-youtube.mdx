Pieces was showcased on GitHub’s YouTube channel and across their social media to hundreds of thousands of subscribers. This was the inaugural episode of GitHub’s ‘Start it up Wednesday,’ a new show hosted by GitHub’s Rizel Scarlett. Tsavo showcased a modern developer’s workflow on the episode titled, “Optimizing your Development Workflow with AI.”

The Live Stream was over an hour long and showcased cutting edge machine learning that left the audience awestruck. Tsavo demoed the latest features of the Pieces Desktop app, including the ability to generate new code from a short plain English description, provide relevant descriptions and links to external resources, and share with teammates (soon via Microsoft Teams). He also demonstrated offline capabilities, proving that the age of on-device ML is here.
