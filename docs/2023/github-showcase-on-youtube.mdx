Pieces was showcased on GitHub's YouTube channel and across their social media to hundreds of thousands of subscribers. This was the inaugural episode of GitHub's "Start it up Wednesday," a new show hosted by GitHub's Rizel Scarlett. Tsavo Knott demonstrated how Pieces for Developers integrates with a modern developer's workflow on the episode titled, “Optimizing your Development Workflow with AI.”

The livestream was over an hour long and showcased cutting-edge machine learning that left the audience awestruck. Knott demoed the latest features of the Pieces Desktop app, including the ability to generate new code from a short, plain English description, provide relevant descriptions and links to external resources, and share with teammates (soon via Microsoft Teams). He also demonstrated offline capabilities, proving that the age of on-device ML is here.
