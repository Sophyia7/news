Tsavo joined the AI in Business Podcast to discuss what we are building at Pieces for Developers and how our tools can be used by individual developers and teams to get the most from their workflow.

The [AI in Business Podcast](https://podcast.emerj.com/solving-software-developer-challenges-with-ai-with-tsavo-knott-of-pieces) “is for non-technical business leaders who need to find AI opportunities, align AI capabilities with strategy, and deliver ROI.”

This is a great podcast for those exploring how best to integrate AI into their company and how to think about AI as a tool to improve existing workflows.
