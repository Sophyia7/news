In May 2023, several members of our Engineering team exhibited Pieces at InfoShare, the largest tech event in CEE. Pieces for Developers was one of the first booths that attendees could visit upon entering the exhibit hall, and our team shared Pieces with hundreds of developers.

Our team greatly enjoyed their time at InfoShare, as it allowed us to more closely connect with our users and gather valuable feedback on Pieces for Developers.
