Pieces was proud to be a presenting sponsor for Startup Cincy Week. During this week, the startup community in Cincinnati & Northern Kentucky comes together to celebrate, promote, and spur the innovation ecosystem that is gaining momentum here in Southern Ohio and the greater Midwest.

CEO Tsavo Knott addressed the crowd at the official event kickoff, and the rest of the team engaged in sessions and panel discussions throughout the week. We had a wonderful time connecting with old friends and making new ones. The Pieces for Developers team is proud to support fellow Cincinnati startups and looks forward to next yearâ€™s event!
