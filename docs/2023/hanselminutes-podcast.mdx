Our CEO, Tsavo Knott, joined developer legend Scott Hanselman as a guest [on his podcast](https://hanselminutes.com/913/redefining-developer-workflow-with-piecesapps-tsavo-knott). Scott is a well-known personality in the developer space and serves as the Vice President of Developer Community at Microsoft.

They discussed what we are building at Pieces for Developers, how we are redefining developer productivity, and how we focus on the details of a developer workflow to clear out those developer bottlenecks.

Scott mentioned a handful of tools that help you write code, but made the point that none of them acknowledge “the 50 tabs” and the monitor full of sticky notes. From there, the conversation goes on to discuss how these tools work and learn with the developer and support teams as they evolve in a new world of generative AI workflows.
