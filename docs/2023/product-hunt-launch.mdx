Launching on Product Hunt is one of the most exciting things you can do as a startup. It can be a way to break into the market, disrupt current technologies, and deploy new ideas that change the way consumers think about their current products. Product Hunt is the place to discover and launch new tech products.

Hundreds of products are launched every day, bringing in close to 5 million monthly visitors to the site. That group is mostly composed of tech enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and investors. Throughout the day, the products that receive the most engagement and upvotes from the audience work their way to the top of the list.

Once all the dust settled, Pieces for Developers came in at 5th overall! We received a great deal of feedback, support, and partnership opportunities from the launch. All of this paired with our solid growth was a great way to close out the 2nd quarter and set us up for a successful second half of the year!
